#**Data Cleaning and EDA Chatbot**
This project is a web application built using Streamlit to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a CSV file. It provides a user-friendly interface to handle missing values, visualize data, and gain insights through statistical summaries and plots.

##Features
 - File Upload: Upload a CSV file to get started.
 - Data Cleaning:
     Handling missing values (replacing with mean/median for numeric columns and mode for categorical columns).
     Removing duplicate rows.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     Summary statistics for numerical columns.
     Histograms for visualizing the distribution of each numeric column.
     Correlation matrix with a heatmap for understanding relationships between variables.
     Box plots for each numeric column to identify outliers.
##Tech Stack
        Python: Core programming language used.
        Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
        pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
        NumPy: For numerical computations.
        Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
